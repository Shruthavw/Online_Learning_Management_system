## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
The Online LMS enables:  
- **User Registration & Authentication** (Students, Instructors, Admin)  
- **Course Creation & Management**  
- **Assignment Upload & Submission Tracking**  
- **Progress Reports & Grades**  
- **Discussion Forums** for collaborative learning  
- REST API endpoints for integration with modern frontends (React, mobile apps, etc.)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Build a **secure backend** with token-based authentication (JWT).  
- Design **normalized database schemas** for efficient course, user, and assignment management.  
- Create **REST APIs** for flexible integration with multiple clients.  
- Enable role-based permissions to ensure data privacy and access control.
